            SeeShells is essentially an information extraction software.
            The objective is to create a standalone open source executable that can run both online and offline.
            It will extract and parse through Windows Registry information. This data will then be converted into two forms.
            The first is a csv file that will contain all the raw data we obtain. The second is a human readable timeline.
            The timeline will provide an interactive easier to read visualization of the data extracted from the windows registries,
            which is otherwise difficult and time consuming to comb through and understand.
