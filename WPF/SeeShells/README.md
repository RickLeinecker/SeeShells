# SeeShells
SeeShells collects ShellBags specific Windows Registry keys and parses through them, and organizes the data found in them to display them on a graphical timeline. The graphical timeline is the unique feature that SeeShells offers over other existing parsers: this timeline makes ShellBag data easier to understand and facilitates the process of finding a significant pattern or piece of evidence.
